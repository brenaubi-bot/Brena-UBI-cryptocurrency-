# Brena: Human‑Only Digital Currency with Built‑in UBI

*Draft v1.0 – Living Document*  
This white paper is a working draft. It will evolve through community input and further technical development. Readers are encouraged to contribute ideas, improvements, and critiques.

## 1. Introduction
- The current global monetary systems—whether fiat or cryptocurrency—fail to guarantee fair access and universal inclusion.  
- Fiat money can be inflated, restricted, or manipulated by governments and banks.  
- Cryptocurrencies provide decentralization but concentrate wealth in early adopters and miners, leaving billions excluded.  
- Brena answers this by embedding Universal Basic Income (UBI) into the protocol itself.  
- Unlike policy‑based UBI, Brena guarantees every living human receives a fair monthly share—mathematically, privately, and sustainably.

## 2. Core Principles
**Human‑Generated Wallets (HGWs):**
- One per living human, created through on‑device liveness and uniqueness checks.  
- Eligible for monthly UBI payouts.  
- Cannot be duplicated or transferred to another person.  

**General Wallets (GWs):**
- Unlimited in number, anyone can create them just like Bitcoin/Ethereum wallets.  
- Not eligible for UBI distributions.  
- Ideal for businesses, organizations, exchanges, or personal savings.  

**Fixed Supply:** 432 billion Brena, divisible into Brena Dollars (3,000 per Brena) and cents.  
**Distribution:** A monthly distribution pool is created and shared equally across HGWs. Rate capped at 9B HGWs for stability.

## 3. Enrollment and Proof‑of‑Life
- Enrollment is done privately on the user’s own device.  
- Multimodal liveness checks: heartbeat via skin tone, pupil reflex, microsaccades, breath sync, touch jitter.  
- Uniqueness anchor: a sealed biometric template (iris/FaceID depth map) stored only in the device’s Secure Enclave/Keystore.  
- Proof‑of‑Personhood Token (PoPT): a cryptographic freshness token, signed and verified with ZK proofs on‑chain.  
- Periodic liveness refresh (every 3–6 months) keeps HGWs active; missed refreshes trigger Dormant status.

## 4. Distribution Dynamics
- Every 30 days, Brena opens a Distribution Pool by drawing a fraction of total supply.  
- The size of the pool grows with the number of active HGWs, capped at the equivalent of 9 billion participants.  
- Each HGW can claim one equal share of that month’s pool.  
- If HGW count is less than or equal to 9B: per‑human payout is higher.  
- If HGW count exceeds 9B: the same capped pool is shared across all HGWs, so per‑human payout decreases proportionally.  
- This ensures fairness, predictability, and long‑term stability, even as humanity’s population grows.

## 5. Resilience Against Fraud & AGI
- Software deepfakes blocked by multimodal liveness signals.  
- Masks or prosthetics cannot simulate blood flow or pupil reflex.  
- High‑end animatronics would cost $200k–$500k per model with <0.1% success rate.  
- AGI attacks forced into expensive physical fraud that cannot scale.  
- Enrollment throttling uses VRF lotteries or regional caps based on population.  
- The app evolves, rotating challenges and learning patterns to stay ahead of spoofing attempts.

## 6. Inheritance Structure
- Brena supports inheritance without exposing identity.  
- Users assign Trusted Wallets with percentages (e.g., 50/30/20).  
- Non‑transferable right: HGW/UBI eligibility ends with the human. Only balances transfer.  
- Missed liveness checks → Dormant status → Grace window (60–90 days).  
- If still inactive:  
  - If inheritance is set: balances flow automatically to Trusted Wallets.  
  - If inheritance is not set: balances are redistributed across the network by rolling them into the next Distribution Pool, so all active HGWs benefit.  
- Options: lump sum, time‑locked drips, or vesting.  
- Optional guardian co‑signs and charity fallback ensure resilience.

## 7. Privacy Guarantees
- No biometrics, DNA, GPS, or identity ever leave the device.  
- Zero‑Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) enforce one‑human‑one‑claim without revealing identity.  
- Smart contracts are open‑source and auditable.  
- Users see transparency messages: “✅ Proof sent; ❌ No personal data shared.”

## 8. Conclusion
Brena is not just a currency—it is a monetary protocol designed for fairness, resilience, and humanity itself.  

- Fairness: Built‑in UBI, no one excluded.  
- Security: Resistant to AGI and large‑scale fraud.  
- Privacy: No central authority holds personal data.  
- Continuity: Inheritance and dormancy rules circulate wealth human‑to‑human.  

**A money that answers the problems of both fiat and crypto, designed for humanity itself.**
